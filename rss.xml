            <title><![CDATA[Instapost]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Instapost</h1><p>The past week didn´t start too well. After a casual get-together with my new colleagues from SEDPI on Friday I fell sick with fever and a cold. I guess my body is not used to common intoxicating substances anymore.The rest of the week I continued preparing credit appraisals for our MFI clients. The “creative” accounting practices especially of smaller MFIs and interrupted reporting make this work at times challenging. It is a good way to recall my accounting classes at Maastricht University and provides me with interesting insights into the operations of different MFIs.Toward the end of the week we decided to postpone the credit appraisals until we receive all the missing data from our clients. In the mean time I began preparing the account data for our investors´ online platform, which launches next week.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ae4934d619ff9ca54c52d32bed55c03cd2ec6bb3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Looking back and ahead</h1><p>Two months into 2016 this post comes (I admit it) slightly delayed. The past three weeks were very exciting for me. I had two job interviews for internships and started working for SEDPI. Aside from my new internship I´ll have more interesting stuff to share with you so I did not want to delay this post any further. Bear with me and stay tuned!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9c97b0850bb3faca2a673d22a5b09e0c8dea0f3f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
