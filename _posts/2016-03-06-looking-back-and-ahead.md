Two months into 2016 this post comes (I admit it) slightly delayed. The past three weeks were very exciting for me. I had two job interviews for internships and started working for _[SEDPI][0]._Aside from my new internship I´ll have more interesting stuff to share with you so I did not want to delay this post any further. Bear with me and stay tuned!

At the end of December it is a collective habit to reflect about past twelve months and to come up with resolutions for the new year. Looking back on 2015 I wouldn´t have done much different.

In January, I finished my bachelor thesis about investing strategies in bubble markets.

A few days after submitting it I flew to Myanmar to travel the country for three weeks.

Next was my semester abroad in South Korea. My time at_Seoul National University_(_SNU_) was the best semester of my studies (not very surprising). I met the amazing_Breakfast Club_, many more great people from all-around the world and my best friend since high school days. In addition, I experienced the exciting South Korean culture.

After my time in Korea, I visit another old high school friend in the Philippines. During the first night out I got introduced to the _[Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation][1]_(_NWTF_).

August I spend at home with trips to Paris and Berlin.

In  September after the quick interlude in good, old Europe I went back to the Philippines for my internship with_NWTF_. I also managed to complete my first online course _[Foundations of Development Policy][2]_ (after a countless failed attempts in the past years to finish an online course). This course was an eye-opener to the effectiveness of randomised control trials and statistical analysis in development work.

Following my experience in 2015 I am more determined than ever to pursue a career in the development sector. At the moment I feel drawn to the research projects by organisations such as _[JPAL][3]_or _[IPA][4]_t o shed some more light on effective interventions in development work. I also decided on some goals for 2016\. Here is what I want to do in the coming months:

* read more books (I am a slow reader and tend to read countless articles via _[pocket][5]_so I´d be happy to finish 12 books by the end of the year)
* get familiar with R, STATA or Python to become better at statistical analysis (is a requirement in every job opening that I get excited about lately)
* write regularly on this blog (I have to admit this one is a classic resolution for me)
* learn to meditate. (I  gave it a try last year with _[headspace][6]_ but its definitely worth a second try)
* complete another online course. (There are so [many][7] exciting courses out there that the  real challenge for me is to decide on which course to focus on)

Now that my goals are listed here I have to admit that  I don´t believe in static goal setting. I´d rather change my goals along the way as long as I pursue them with determination. This mindset worked out for me quiet well so far.  I am excited to see how the coming 11 months play out for me!
