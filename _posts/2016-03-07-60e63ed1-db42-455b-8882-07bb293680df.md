The past week didn´t start too well. After a casual get-together with my new colleagues from SEDPI on Friday I fell sick with fever and a cold. I guess my body is not used to common intoxicating substances anymore.  
The rest of the week I continued preparing credit appraisals for our MFI clients. The "creative" accounting practices especially of smaller MFIs and interrupted reporting make this work at times challenging. It is a good way to recall my accounting classes at Maastricht University and provides me with interesting insights into the operations of different MFIs.  
Toward the end of the week we decided to postpone the credit appraisals until we receive all the missing data from our clients. In the mean time I began preparing the account data for our investors´ online platform, which launches next week.

One of the more memorable moments of the week was when I was spontaneously invited to help fight food waste. During one of my colleagues workshops there was still leftover food. Luckily it is already common practices to bring leftovers home but this time it was still too much. It was a workshop about knowledge exchange of climate change mitigation and resilience practices for local government units. Ironically only meat and fish was served. While I understand that most people are not vegetarians it would still be a good signal when internationally and ideally also nationally funded climate change projects are obliged to serve climate-friendly food. While the immediate impact might be minuscule it would at least send the right signals and promote climate friendly catering. In the end I followed my personal policy of "no food waste" and helped decimate the leftovers successfully. \#philippines \#quezoncity \#internship \#mfi \#foodwaste \#accounting \#newshores \#instablog \#climatechange \#wearefairphone via Instagram [http://bit.ly/1KM4Ea6][0]
