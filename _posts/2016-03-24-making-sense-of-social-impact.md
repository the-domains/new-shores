  Last year I completed my first two online courses. I learnt about development
  policy and impact assessments. It still amazes me that everyone with an
  internet connection is now able to take courses from the best universities in
  the world without having to pay a cent. MIT, Harvard and Oxford, etc. offer
  free online courses in any possible subject.

Last year I completed my first two online courses. I learnt about development policy and impact assessments. It still amazes me that everyone with an internet connection is now able to take courses from the best universities in the world without having to pay a cent. _[MIT][0]_[, ][0]_[Harvard ][0]_[and ][0]_[Oxford][0]_, etc. offer free online courses in any possible subject.

I havenÂ´t studied development studies or related courses in my bachelor. Thus, online courses are a great opportunity for me to advance my knowledge in this field. Since we moved to _QuezonCity_, which has a substantially better internet connection than _Bacolod_ taking classes is very convenient.
![Back in Baguio over holy week to escape the rising heat of Manila](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d552d03b-37c9-4ecd-aeb1-a67f1d090b8d.png)

Last week I started a course by [+][1]_[AcumenMaking Sense of Social Impact][1]. +Acumen _is the public education and community division of one of my favourite social enterprises _[Acumen Fund][2],_which is one of the first _[impact investors][3]._ It finances social enterprises in developing countries and is expanding around the globe.

The online course is an introductory course into social impact measurement. Impact measurement is increasingly important for charities and social enterprises. A growing number of donors and investors demand robust impact measurements as part of their financing process. This is a [promising trend][4]. Money for development work and social enterprises is not abundant. Only the most effective and cost-efficient projects, initiatives and enterprises should receive funding. Impact assessments also help organisations to improve their work by pointing out wasteful spending and bad practices.

I am especially excited to complete this course because I am currently working on an impact assessment myself. The company I am interning for _[SEDPI][5] (Social Enterprise Development Partnership, Inc.)_ offers financial literacy to overseas Filipino workers. This program has been running for several years already with more than 1,000 participants.

At the moment I am analyzing data from a sample of 200 participants to determine the strengths, weaknesses and the impact of the program. The data already revealed some valuable insights about some aspects of the program, which have to be improved.

I am excited to see what further insights my analysis will provide in the coming weeks.

The infographic below provides a short profile of the financial literacy training:
