description: "What differentiates valid elections from surveys is strong identity validation. We are working with pioneering decentralized protocols for identification, so no single corporation (like Facebook) or government (think Estonia) owns your credentials. Only you are in control. Whether it's a club, a student center, your football team, a corporation, a workers union or even a big city: these are all institutions."
